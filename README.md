# Stretch plugin for Craft CMS 4.5
Let your content stretch out and breathe. Toggle the control panel’s right details pane on entry edit pages to free up more screen real estate for editing your content. Handy when editing content on smaller screen devices e.g. iPad.

## Requirements
This plugin requires Craft CMS 4.5.13 or later.

## Installation
### Composer
To install the plugin, follow these steps:

1. Install with Composer via:
   `composer require richhayler/stretch`

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Stretch.

### Craft Plugin Store
You can also install Stretch via the **Plugin Store** in the Craft control panel.

## Using Stretch
Once installed, a persistent menu will appear at the top of the control panel on entry edit sections. When you need more desktop space on the admin screens click the menu icon to hide the right details pane.
